# AQI Monitoring for Montreal

This script fetches air quality data from monitoring stations on the island of Montr√©al, calculates the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on pollutant concentrations, and provides the results. A similar logic is used for the custom component for Home Assistant.

## Features

- Fetches the latest air quality data from Montreal's open data portal.
- Calculates the AQI contribution for various pollutants.
- Lists available air quality monitoring stations.
- Allows querying specific stations for AQI information.
- Supports debugging with detailed logs.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- `requests` library

You can install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Usage

Run the script with the following options:

### Fetch AQI for a specific station

```bash
python test_api.py --station <station_id>
```

Example:

```bash
python test_api.py --station 1
```

### List available monitoring stations

```bash
python test_api.py --list
```

### Enable debug logging

To enable debug logging for more detailed output, use:

```bash
python test_api.py --debug --station <station_id>
```

### Run interactively

If no station ID is provided, the script will prompt for input:

```bash
python test_api.py
Enter Station ID: <station_id>
```

## Example Output

```
2025-01-31 10:00:00 - INFO - Fetching latest data for station 1...
2025-01-31 10:00:01 - INFO - Found latest data at hour 9.
2025-01-31 10:00:01 - INFO - The air quality index for station 1 is 42.
```

## Logging Levels

- **INFO**: Default mode, displays essential messages.
- **DEBUG**: Provides detailed logs including fetched data and calculations.

## How AQI is Calculated

The contribution of each pollutant to the AQI is calculated using the formula:

![AQI Equation](../docs/aqi_equation.png)


where:
- `value` is the measured concentration of the pollutant.
- `ref_value` is the reference concentration for that pollutant.
